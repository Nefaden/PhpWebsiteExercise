# PHP Course Website for beginners

Welcome to this little course of PHP for beginners.

I've made this website for a friend in need to learn and practice PHP, and I wanted to share it if it can help more than one person.

First of all, one rule : do not push on this repo, made your own in first place :)

To do this, you've got 2 options :
1. click on "Clone or Download" button, copy the url and clone it on your IDE.
  a. For some of IDE, Git is automatically added as "Team" option in your options bar (select "Clone" option).
  b. For others, you'll need to download git plugin or Git bash to clone it by yourself. You can find some tutorials to do this.
  
2. Download the zip when you clicked on the "Clone or Download" button
  a. Dezip it in your project's folder
  b. Open it in your IDE

You'll certainly need to set-up the project with your local server and the main page as the index.

When you did this, let's go !

This website is split evenly between all exercise i've made to increase and improve your skill in PHP, you've got 1 page for 1 exercise.
Each exercises need to be complete on each pages where they're linked (someone need to use more classes, obviously)
